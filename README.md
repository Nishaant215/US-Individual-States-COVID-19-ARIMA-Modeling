# US-Individual-States-COVID-19-ARIMA-Modeling <br>
ARIMA time series modeling for all 50 states to see COVID-19 cases forecast in the next 30 days <br>

<b> Time Series Forecasting </b> <br>
The process of using a statistical model to predict future values of a time series based on past results and present data. 
For our model we used ARIMA model, which stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. <br>

For detailed break down check out the Jupter Notebook file <br>

After the forecasting the graphs were cateogorized as low, medium, high risk states which are organized into 3 pdf files : <br>
Multi-Low-COVID_Plot <br>
Multi-Medium-COVID_Plot<br>
Multi-High-COVID_Plot<br>
